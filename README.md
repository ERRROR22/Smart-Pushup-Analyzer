# AI Pushup Form Corrector / Smart-Pushup-Analyzer

A real-time AI fitness system that detects pushup form correctness and counts repetitions using Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Real-time human pose detection using MediaPipe
* Machine Learning-based form classification (Random Forest)
* Rep counting system using joint angle tracking
* Smart feedback system (Good form / Fix form / Go lower / Keep body straight)
* Voice feedback for each rep
* Temporal smoothing for stable predictions
* Position gating to avoid false detections

---

## 🧠 Key Innovation

Unlike traditional rule-based systems, this project uses a trained Machine Learning model to classify pushup form based on biomechanical features such as:

* Arm angle
* Body alignment angle
* Hip offset

The model achieves ~88% accuracy and performs reliably in real-time conditions with noisy pose data.

## ⚙️ Challenges Solved

* **Noisy pose detection** → handled using moving average smoothing
* **Flickering predictions** → solved using temporal buffering (deque)
* **False detections (e.g., sitting)** → fixed using posture gating
* **Inconsistent rep counting** → stabilized with threshold tuning

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Capture video using OpenCV
2. Detect body landmarks using MediaPipe
3. Calculate biomechanical features:

   * Arm angle
   * Body angle
   * Hip offset
4. Feed features into trained ML model
5. Apply smoothing to stabilize predictions
6. Generate real-time feedback and count reps
